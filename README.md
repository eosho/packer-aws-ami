# Packer AMI build
This script creates an AMI on a local Agent.  

## Requirements
* An AWS account with permissions to create EC2 instances and AMIs
* [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure your aws credentials have been configured.  These scripts expect to use [Automatic Lookup](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/amazon.html#specifying-amazon-credentials).  To use a profile other than default, set the env variable `AWS_PROFILE` to the profile name.
1. Clone or download this repo
1. In the repo folder run 
    ```
    packer build bamboo-server.json
    ```
1. Go make a cup of coffee
1. Once finished, check the output for successful test results.
1. Your AMI is now ready to launch
1. Amend your instance's [Security Group rules](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#AddRemoveRules) to allow TCP inbound over port 8085.
1. Once launched navigate to `http://<instanceip>:8085` to complete the [Bamboo setup wizard](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/running-the-setup-wizard-289276851.html).

**Note:** The Bamboo Server is set up as a service but does not have logon credentials.  These will need to be set once the Administrator password is known after you've launched your instance.  Follow these [instructions for running Bamboo as a Service](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamkb/running-bamboo-as-a-windows-service-troubleshooting-guide-420973231.html).
